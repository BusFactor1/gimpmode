  You have an interactive, console-like buffer, and multiple source
  buffers in which to edit text. There is a plethora of commands,
  functions and variables that you'd like to make available in both
  modes.  Say we want some keys to perform certain actions in both
  modes, but the console mode is derived from - say - comint-mode and
  the text buffer mode is derived from lisp-mode.
