	* gimp-mode.el (gimp-current-arg): fixed eob error

=======
2008-07-03  Niels Giesen  <sharik@reetkevert.sshunet.nl>

	* gimp-mode.el (gimp-try-and-get-closure-code-p): new custom
	variable that defines whether or not to get a function/macros
	closure code for doc echoing (to speed up interactive use, mainly
	in slow client mode).
	(gimp-get-closure-code): first check whether symbol is bound
	before trying to get the closure code to avoid error.

	* gimp-init.el: load gimp-vars.el to read in install-time variables.

	* gimp-install.el: simplified script for shell invocation

	* build.sh: add emacs invocation of build.el

	* gimp-mode.el (gimp-src-dir): moved to gimp-vars.el (which is written at
	install-time)
	(gimp-describe-procedure): adjusted argument option parsing for dump.db
	(gimp-get-proc-arg-descriptive-name): adjusted argument option parsing for dump.db

2008-06-22  Niels Giesen  <sharik@reetkevert.sshunet.nl>

	* gimp-mode.el (gimp-first-run-action): removed automatic
	configuration, since this is moved to gimp-install.el
	(gimp-apropos): made gimp-apropos a real apropos instead of simple
	name-matching

2008-06-11    <ngiesen@NIELS>

	* gimp-mode.el (gimp-insert-sexp-at-repl): (use function
	gimp-buffer)
	(gimp-first-run-action): make copy instead of symbolic link when
	last is impossible
	(gimp-read-dump): mapcar -> mapc
	(gimp-complete-oblist): stand-alone functino, to be pushed into
	hippie-expand-try-functions-list. Needs further refinement (?)
 
>>>>>>> 1.17
2008-06-08  Niels Giesen  <sharik@reetkevert.sshunet.nl>

	* gimp-mode.el (gimp-fnsym-in-current-sexp): fixed bug for when
	string before has comma, and made a backout for when meeting the
	process-mark.

2008-06-07  niels giesen  <sharik@matroshka>

	* gimp-mode.el: save and restore input ring also in client mode.

	(thingatpt): added load-time requirement
	(gimp-cl-proc): added client process
	(gimp-insert-quotes-for-strings-p): added option for automatic
	quote insertion (as this might be annoying when in fact you want a
	sexp)
	(gimp-mode): added value 'lisp-indent-line for
	`indent-line-function' so indent-region does the right thing (TM).
	(gimp-gimp-mode-version): return nil (not a string), so that when
	invoked from interactive buffer, DTRT (TM)
	(gimp-proc): offer gimp-cl-proc as a fallback

2008-05-22  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp-mode.el (gimp-arg-from-scraped-registration): add
	registered args, plus faces for traces).

2008-05-19  Niels Giesen  <sharik@reetkevert.sshunet.nl>

	* gimp-mode.el (gimp-completion-rules): add other caches + fuzzy
	completion

	* emacs-interaction.scm: Add other caches

2008-05-17  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp-mode.el (load): Cool gimp-faces. Non-interactive mode.

	* emacs-interaction.scm: registered procedure
	`script-fu-dump-for-emacs' (with args) under script-fu menu. Added
	a trick to run the cache-dump only the first-time.

2008-05-16  Niels Giesen  <sharik@reetkevert.sshunet.nl>

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): added faces to Gimp Help, and
	compiler-soothing stuff.
2008-05-16  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp-mode.el: Huge changes, most stuff depends now on gimp-dump,
	and gimp-pdb-cache which is derived from the former. Gimp Help has
	true history, major clickability, cleaned up
	gimp-completion-rules. Probably some more stuff I forgot.

	* emacs-interaction.scm: deleted all old interaction functions,
	saving just the stuff to dump info with emacs-cache.

2008-05-11  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* emacs-interaction.scm: add emacs-only-bound-symbols? to specify
	what symbols you would like to see present in completions. Added
	emacs-interaction-possible? to check whether emacs-interaction.scm
	has actually been loaded.
 
	* README: misc changes

	* gimp-init.el (Module): Changed order, added TOC, stuff like that

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): 

	* gimp-init.el (gimp-mode-dir): added gimp-mode-dir as a defvar
	for later symlinking emacs-interaction.scm on execution of run-gimp

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): redesigned gimp-eval and
	gimp-eval-string (now simply checks for prompt to see whether the
	gimp has returned). Let's see how they work.
 
2008-05-10  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* README (Module): update to reflect changes
	
	* emacs-interaction.scm (Module): emacs-caches now also creates a
	menu file

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): Added a menu interface `gimp-menu'

2008-05-05  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp.el (Module): added documentation for main interactive
	functions.

2008-05-04  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp.el (gimp-doc): Added doc-echoing for any function that
	TinyScheme can provide code of (via `get-closure-code'). And
	positionalized core scheme echoing. Dotted argument lists are
	handled by converting them to normal lists first, where the atom
	after the dot gets a dot prepended (as a string).

2008-05-02  Niels Giesen  <sharik@reetkevert.sshunet.nl>

	* gimp-init.el (Module): made external libs not optionally 

	* gimp.el (Module): 

	* emacs-interaction.scm (Module): loaded by the Gimp on startup;
	defines functions and makes cache files to be read by emacs.
