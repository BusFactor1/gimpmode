	functions.

	* gimp.el (gimp-doc): Added doc-echoing for any function that
	TinyScheme can provide code of (via `get-closure-code'). And
	positionalized core scheme echoing. Dotted argument lists are
	handled by converting them to normal lists first, where the atom
	after the dot gets a dot prepended (as a string).
