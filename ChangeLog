	* emacs-interaction.scm: add emacs-only-bound-symbols? to specify
	what symbols you would like to see present in completions. Added
	emacs-interaction-possible? to check whether emacs-interaction.scm
	has actually been loaded.
 
	* README: misc changes

	* gimp-init.el (Module): Changed order, added TOC, stuff like that

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): 

	* gimp-init.el (gimp-mode-dir): added gimp-mode-dir as a defvar
	for later symlinking emacs-interaction.scm on execution of run-gimp

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): redesigned gimp-eval and
	gimp-eval-string (now simply checks for prompt to see whether the
	gimp has returned). Let's see how they work.

	* README (Module): update to reflect changes
	
	* emacs-interaction.scm (Module): emacs-caches now also creates a
	menu file

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): Added a menu interface `gimp-menu'

2008-05-05  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp.el (Module): added documentation for main interactive
	functions.

2008-05-04  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp.el (gimp-doc): Added doc-echoing for any function that
	TinyScheme can provide code of (via `get-closure-code'). And
	positionalized core scheme echoing. Dotted argument lists are
	handled by converting them to normal lists first, where the atom
	after the dot gets a dot prepended (as a string).

	* gimp-init.el (Module): made external libs not optionally 

	* gimp.el (Module): 

	* emacs-interaction.scm (Module): loaded by the Gimp on startup;
	defines functions and makes cache files to be read by emacs.
