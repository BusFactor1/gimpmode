	* gimp-mode.el (load): Cool gimp-faces. Non-interactive mode.

	* emacs-interaction.scm: registered procedure
	`script-fu-dump-for-emacs' (with args) under script-fu menu. Added
	a trick to run the cache-dump only the first-time.

2008-05-16  Niels Giesen  <sharik@reetkevert.sshunet.nl>

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): added faces to Gimp Help, and
	compiler-soothing stuff.
2008-05-16  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp-mode.el: Huge changes, most stuff depends now on gimp-dump,
	and gimp-pdb-cache which is derived from the former. Gimp Help has
	true history, major clickability, cleaned up
	gimp-completion-rules. Probably some more stuff I forgot.

	* emacs-interaction.scm: deleted all old interaction functions,
	saving just the stuff to dump info with emacs-cache.

2008-05-11  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* emacs-interaction.scm: add emacs-only-bound-symbols? to specify
	what symbols you would like to see present in completions. Added
	emacs-interaction-possible? to check whether emacs-interaction.scm
	has actually been loaded.
 
	* README: misc changes

	* gimp-init.el (Module): Changed order, added TOC, stuff like that

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): 

	* gimp-init.el (gimp-mode-dir): added gimp-mode-dir as a defvar
	for later symlinking emacs-interaction.scm on execution of run-gimp

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): redesigned gimp-eval and
	gimp-eval-string (now simply checks for prompt to see whether the
	gimp has returned). Let's see how they work.
 
2008-05-10  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* README (Module): update to reflect changes
	
	* emacs-interaction.scm (Module): emacs-caches now also creates a
	menu file

	* gimp-mode.el (Module): Added a menu interface `gimp-menu'

2008-05-05  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp.el (Module): added documentation for main interactive
	functions.

2008-05-04  Niels Giesen  <niels.giesen@gmail.com>

	* gimp.el (gimp-doc): Added doc-echoing for any function that
	TinyScheme can provide code of (via `get-closure-code'). And
	positionalized core scheme echoing. Dotted argument lists are
	handled by converting them to normal lists first, where the atom
	after the dot gets a dot prepended (as a string).

2008-05-02  Niels Giesen  <sharik@reetkevert.sshunet.nl>

	* gimp-init.el (Module): made external libs not optionally 

	* gimp.el (Module): 

	* emacs-interaction.scm (Module): loaded by the Gimp on startup;
	defines functions and makes cache files to be read by emacs.
