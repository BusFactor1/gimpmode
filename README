==Getting started==

Put the following in your startup (~/.emacs) file:

 (require 'gimp-init)

That file sets up some hooks to only load the stuff once needed.  Edit
the file to be consistent with your setup (load-paths an stuff).

Byte compile gimp.el (and optionally scheme-complete.el).

Put the file emacs-interaction.scm (a scheme file that ought to be
loaded for the Gimp to serve us some proper feedback) in

  ~/.gimp-2.4/scripts/

... or in another directory loaded by the Gimp.

On Linux, BSDs and Macs, a symbolic link works fine too (that's what I
do to keep my cvs tree nice in one place).

Now run M-x run-gimp to start the Gimp and its console within Emacs. This takes a while,
so just be patient. Run it with a prefix arg, i.e. C-u M-x run-gimp, to start up the
Gimp without a graphical user interface.

To inquire about gimp-specific keybindings in either `inferior-gimp-mode', `gimp-mode'
or `gimp-help-mode', press C-c? respectively ?.

==Not only for fu==

See the functions `gimp-search-fu', `gimp-search-core-function' and
`gimp-search-plug-in-file'.

`gimp-search-fu' searches the source for script-fu functions
`gimp-search-plug-in-file' searches the source file of specified plug-in
`gimp-search-core-function' tries to find the source definition for core gimp functions.

These functions need the variables `gimp-rel-fu-dir' and `gimp-src-dir' to be set.

==Caveats==

I only have had very little time to test this on a win32 machine. It did not work. I do
not now about its behaviour on OSX.

Newly created gimp-functions are not available in completion candidates during
the same session.

I have not yet written a single script-fu file to test this mode. Please give
me something to work on.

==ToDo==

Make completion user-definable, as in a list of form

   ((test . list-or-function)...)

TIP on using `emacs-w3m' to browse gimp documentation:

To use emacs-w3m as the browser for help files from within the Gimp, put the
following in your .gimprc:

(help-browser web-browser)
(web-browser "emacsclient -e '(w3m-browse-url \"%s\")'")

and (server-start) in your .emacs

Browsing the help with emacs-w3m is very nice, esp. since you can make use of the
ubiquitous w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url, w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url (SPACE) and
w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url (b)
